How to clone and build the project from the GitHub 

1. Create a folder you want to handle the project and clone the 
project from the GitHub by running 
"git clone https://github.com/palych-piter/Excel2DB.git". 
The Excel2Db subfolder should be created.

2. Run the "gradle shadowJar" gradle command. You should have the 
Gradle pre-installed.

3. All is set. The "build/libs/" subfolder should have the newest jar file
generated in the excel2db-<version>.jar format. By default the subfolder contains the property file pointing to
the Derby database as the testing implementation and test.xlsx 
as the test Excel file.
